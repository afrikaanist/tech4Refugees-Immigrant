    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Tech4Refugees was founded by <strong>Afrikaan Sahra</strong>, a refugee dedicated to changing lives through advocacy, business and technology<a href="【13735905412040†L6-L9】">[1]</a>. After witnessing the impact of limited connectivity and resources in refugee camps, Afrikaan envisioned a world where displaced people could access education, employment and community through digital tools.</p>
    <p>Our organisation believes that technology is a powerful equaliser. By equipping refugees and immigrants with digital skills and access to information, we empower them to build new futures for themselves and their communities. The statement “There is no greater opportunity than to change the world through technology” is not just a slogan<a href="【110622199308685†L9-L10】">[2]</a>; it is the guiding principle behind all of our initiatives.</p>
    <p>Since our inception, Tech4Refugees has grown into a community of volunteers, educators, technologists and refugee leaders working together to close the digital divide. We collaborate with universities, non‑profits and technology companies to deliver impactful programmes and amplify refugee voices.</p>
